# FINAL_PROJECT

This code deals with a web application that allows the management of overseas students and scholarships. It enables users to perform CRUDCreate, Read, Update, Delete operations on student and scholarship data. SQLite is used as a database for this application, and the backend has been implemented in Python using Bottle's Web Framework.
 The main features are to add, update and remove student records, view a list of students and scholarships as well as search for them using their first or last names. The application also makes use of HTML templates for displaying the views, and is in line with a Relational Database Model to organise data.
